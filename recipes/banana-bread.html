		<h1>Banana Zucchini Bread</h1>
		<p>This banana zucchini bread combines two of my favorites: banana walnut bread and zucchini bread. I like to add dried cranberries for an extra boost of flavor in every bite.</p>

		<h2>Banana Zucchini Bread Ingredients</h2>
		<p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this banana zucchini bread recipe:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three eggs add moisture and help hold the batter together.</li>
			<li><strong>Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends even more moisture.</li>
			<li><strong>Sugars:</strong> This banana zucchini bread recipe calls for both brown and white sugars.</li>
			<li><strong>Zucchini and bananas:</strong> Of course, you'll need grated zucchini and mashed bananas!</li>
			<li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of this simple quick bread.</li>
			<li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the banana zucchini bread structure.</li>
			<li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon lends welcome pleasant warmth.</li>
			<li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
			<li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make your bread taste salty.</li>
			<li><strong>Cranberries:</strong> Dried cranberries give the bread bursts of fruity flavor.</li>
			<li><strong>Walnuts:</strong> Chopped walnuts add crunch and nutty flavor.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
		<p>"Excellent recipe," raves one Allrecipes community member. "I ran out of vanilla extract, so I used cognac instead."</p>
		<p>"A great bread that was moist, with both zucchini and banana flavor," according to jenk. "I halved the cranberries and nuts and only put in one of the two loaves to satisfy my picky eaters. Both were great! Will make it again."</p>
		<p>"For some reason this bread seems healthier than plain banana bread," says lobij. "The zucchini adds moisture to the batter, which results in a nice textured loaf. Added bonus: The kids don't realize there is a veggie in their banana bread."</p>

			<li>3 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
			<li>1 cup grated zucchini</li>

			<li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch bread loaf pans.</li>
			<li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light yellow and frothy. Add white sugar, zucchini, oil, bananas, brown sugar, and vanilla; beat until well combined. Stir in flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Fold in cranberries and nuts. Divide batter evenly between the prepared loaf pans.</li>
