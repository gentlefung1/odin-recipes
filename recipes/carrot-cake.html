		<h1>Does Carrot Cake Need to Be Refrigerated?</h1>
		<p>Yes, carrot cake should be refrigerated. Since it's frosting with a fluffy cream cheese frosting, it shouldn't sit at room temperature for more than two hours at a time.</p>
		<h3>How Long Does Carrot Cake Last? </h3>
		<p>Store the frosted cake cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.</p>
		<h3>Can You Freeze Carrot Cake?</h3>
		<p>You can freeze unfrosted carrot cake for up to three months. Simply wrap the cooled cake in at least one layer of storage wrap, then at least one layer of foil. Thaw in the fridge overnight and frost according to the recipe. </p>
